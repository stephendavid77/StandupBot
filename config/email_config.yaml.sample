# Email Configuration for StandupBot
#
# This file provides a template for configuring email settings.
# For security, it is highly recommended to set these values as environment variables
# rather than directly in this file, especially for sensitive information like passwords.
#
# Environment variables to set:
# EMAIL_SENDER_EMAIL: Your email address (e.g., your.email@example.com)
# EMAIL_SENDER_PASSWORD: Your email password or an app-specific password (recommended for services like Gmail with 2FA enabled).
# EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER: Your email provider's SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com, smtp.office365.com).
# EMAIL_SMTP_PORT: The SMTP port, usually 587 for TLS.
#
# Example (if you choose to put values directly here - NOT RECOMMENDED for production):
# sender_email: your.email@example.com
# sender_password: your_app_password
# smtp_server: smtp.gmail.com
# smtp_port: 587
